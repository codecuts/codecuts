The Official Website for the Record Label Paracadute. The website features an elegant responsive design created by [Daniel Greenfeld](http://danielgreenfeld.com/). Under the hood, the website is integrated with [Podio](http://podio.com), an easy to use business data management application. Information about the label's ablums and artists is pulled in automatically from Podio when it is updated and displayed on the website so that the label does not need to manage the site's content directly.
