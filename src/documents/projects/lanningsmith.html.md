We built this website for the exciting Brooklyn-based crew of production designers and fabricators who go by the name LanningSmith. The inspiration for the site was the studio's own storefront, which they describe this way:

> "The LanningSmith storefront hosts an ongoing and ever-changing series of exhibitions, presentations, brand collaborations and events."

The site we built for LanningSmith, therefore, allows users to filter through the studio's diverse repoitoier of projects. It serves as an instantly updateable and dynamic portfolio. It can even be presented to clients on-site using an iPad.
