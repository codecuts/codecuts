Hidden Recordings is an internationally known techno label whose tracks you can hear in clubs from Berlin to Detroit. The label puts out a torrent of high quality club tracks, hosts parties, produces videos and podcasts, and maintains a social presence on sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube.

The site we built for them, designed by the artist & designer <a target="_blank" href="http://eleanorchung.com">Eleanor Chung</a>. unifies all these realms into a well-designed web hub that mirrors the cohesiveness and energy of the club scene surrounding the label. The website is built on a Wordpress CMS for blogging and also includes involves several automated integrations with Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube that pull in new content as it is produced and posted.
